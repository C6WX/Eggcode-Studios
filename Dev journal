# Research

## What research did you do?
<br> Our research process involved gathering various elements to shape our game's design and style. We started by sourcing images for our characters to establish their look and feel, ensuring they aligned with the aesthetic we envisioned. For the game's style, we decided on 2D pixel art, reflecting a classic, retro-inspired approach. We explored and selected sound effects to match the game's theme, including atmospheric background music to enhance the player's immersion. Additionally, we researched potential enemy types to create diverse and engaging challenges, as well as a variety of weapon types to provide players with exciting gameplay options.</br>

## How did it help?

<br>Our research proved valuable in shaping our project. It gave us a clear and solid vision of what we wanted to create, providing a secure foundation for the entire development process. With a well-defined idea in place, we were able to identify exactly what needed to be done and estimate the time required for each task. This clarity allowed us to approach the project with confidence and efficiency, ensuring that all elements aligned with our overall goals and vision.</br>


# How Did I Make It?

<br>We approached the development of the game by dividing tasks effectively between us. Callum primarily handled the coding, guiding me along the way by using comments in the code to explain functions and processes. Meanwhile, I focused on the level design, creating the sprites, and sourcing images that inspired and brought our ideas to life. I also selected the background music and some sound effects, which we both reviewed and agreed suited the game. This collaboration allowed us to combine our skills and creativity, ensuring a smooth development process and a cohesive final product.</br>

# Reflection

## How did it go?
<br>Overall, I think the project went quite well. We were able to work together effectively, maintaining strong communication throughout the process. This allowed us to share ideas openly and brainstorm creative solutions, ensuring that each aspect of the game aligned with our shared vision. Our collaboration was productive, and the division of tasks played to our strengths, making the development process both efficient and enjoyable.</br>

## What would you do differently?
<br>Upon reflection, there are a few things I would do differently. Firstly, I would aim to stay more consistent with the project timeline, as I fell behind in the first few weeks due to personal issues. Addressing this earlier would have helped maintain steady progress. Secondly, I would focus on improving my coding skills so that I could contribute more effectively to the technical aspects of the project, in addition to my work on the art and design. These changes would not only enhance my contribution but also provide a more balanced workload and a deeper understanding of the development process.</br>
