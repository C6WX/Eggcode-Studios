## Game ideas
### Egg Shooter
- An egg shooter where you shoot targets to knock ingrediants into a bowl to make a cake. 
- The player will have multiple choices of ingrediants that will move across the screen for the player to hit. 
- The player will have limited ammo so if they miss ingrediants, then the cake will turn out weird. 
- After the player uses up their ammo source, the cake will be made and scored based on the ingrediants the player hit.
